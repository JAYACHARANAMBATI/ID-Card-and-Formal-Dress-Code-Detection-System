The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 21 percent of the image
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -10째 to +10째 vertically
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.1 percent of pixels
